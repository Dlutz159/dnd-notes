The party meets in the Yawning Portal seeking their next adventure...

Yesod notes:

A wandering Shifter Druid aligned with the Dream Circle. Ever searching for more insight into the condition of self-awareness that the various races seem to have above creatures, while at the same time strengthening the bond between himself and the natural world. Favorite shape shift is into mountain wolf, with large fangs and a thick silver coat. His greatest fear involves the noon day sun and an arid environment. His greatest aspiration is to achieve druidic enlightenment, becoming and arch druid and having a tangible connectedness with the unity of.... the universe. 

Has no aversion to flame, as he understand destruction to have its necessary place in the circle of life. Overall has a greater tendency to be more offensive than defensive, and listen to the flow of the moment rather than be calculated.
