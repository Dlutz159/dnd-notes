The party made their way from the Yawning Portal to some small town I can't remember the name of.  Then, they made their way into the temple, almost losing to rats along the way.  You managed to avoid a few traps as you entered, and found some writing directing you towards Ashardalon (whatever that might be).   Exploring further, you came across a crying Kobold upset that he lost his dragon.  This Kobold (Meepo) took you to his village's Chief (Yusdraeyl) who tasked you with returning the dragon to them in exchange for a reward (perhaps the key).  You all explored a bit, killing a number of goblins and rats along the way.  The party managed to trigger a poison trap cloud that did some massive damage, but then made quick work of the rat queen.  After a long rest, the party progressed...eventually coming across a trapped (caltrops) and guarded room.  Unsure how to proceed, the party dallied a bit, but eventually ripped a door off of its hinges elsewhere and used it as a shield.   The Toyle, the bard, put a number of goblins to sleep while the party (particularly Danzor) made with the stabby. 

(deep breath)

You found the goblin prison, released (ok, they slipped away as you tried to free them) some captive kobolds, and rescued a gnome cleric named Erky.  The party had Erky help them open a door they previously couldn't open using Erky's "turn undead" ability.  Inside the room, Danzor found a cool magical whistle, and the party made quick work of a few skeletons that arose from their coffins to attack the party.

Erky parted ways and the party headed further into goblin territory searching for the dragon.  Using rogue's tools, Danzor helped avoid some bad guys and the team surprised others.  Eventually finding the dragon's room.  Toyle attempted to put the dragon to sleep, but instead put the party's Sorcerer Zydron to sleep instead.  The dragon used its breath and took out 3/4 remaining party members.  Toyle, who had hung back quickly resuscitated Zydron.   After attempting to trick the dragon with limited success, Zydron burned the shit out of the dragon, killing it.

The party revived the unconscious members and decided to setup the scene such that it appeared the goblins had killed the dragon. Gryff then attempted to get the kobolds to check it out, but they weren't very interested...eventually going to Yusdraeyl who said the deal was off since the dragon was dead, unless the party brought her its head.  The party agreed to sally forth after taking a long rest.

When they awoke, they found a Dwarven Barbarian (Bongor) who agreed to accompany them for a bit to retrieve the goblin chief's head.  

The party then came in like a hurricane, kicking down doors, squashing goblins under doors, and massacreing anything that stood in their way.  While exploring another room, Bongor disappeared on them.

The party continued sneaking around, eventually believing they found the main goblin living quarters.  Taking an alternate route (and locking the folks in the living area), they party attempted to enter what seemed to be the leader's chambers.  Unfortunately, Danzor's mirror was spotted and the creaters within rushed upon and bound the ruffians (I mean the party).

While talking with the goblin chief (Durnn), the party eventually managed to break free thanks to a distraction by Zydron and Volkmar.   ...

After breaking free, the party engaged the hobgoblins to attempt to defeat them.  Of the three hobgoblins, one was thrown down the well and died.  Another was defeated by a savage critical strike from Volkmar.

Toyle put another hobgoblin to sleep, as well as the goblin Grenl.  Durnn awoke the hobgoblin that was asleep and Durnn and the hobgobling engaged the party and quickly did massive amounts of damage.  Party members were dropping like flies.  Danzor jumped across the pit at some point and died shortly thereafter.  Gryff did bring him back to life, but Danzor fell again.

Eventually Durnn (down to 1 hit point, unbeknownst to the party) and the lone hobgobling in green knocked the entire party unconscious shortly after Gryff coup de graced the sleeping Grenl.  The party rolled through their death save where Volkmar and Zydron regretfully completely perished.  Toyle, Gryff, and Danzor found themselves in the dungeon.

The party was then given a few choices: 1) whole party dies, and you restart sunless citadel at level 1.       2) the 3 party members that lived are in a dungeon, Gary & Lance reroll characters.  everyone is level 2    3) move to forge of fury (next module) with entirely new characters for the whole party...all players level 3
